.SH NAME
ccomps \- connected components filter for graphs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ccomps
[
.B \-sxv?
]
[
.BI -o outfile
]
[ 
.I files
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ccomps
decomposes graphs into their connected components,
printing the components to standard output.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP
.B \-s
No output graph is printed. The return value can be used to
check if the graph is connected or not.
.TP
.B \-x
Only the connected components are printed, as separate graphs.
.TP
.B \-v
Counts of nodes, edges and connected components are printed.
.TP
.B \-C
Use clusters in computing components in addition to normal edge
connectivity. In essence, this gives the connected components of the
derived graph in which nodes top-level clusters and nodes in the
original graph. This maintains all subgraph structure within a
component, even if a subgraph does not contain any nodes.
.TP
.B \-n
Do not project subgraph structure. Normally, if 
.B ccomps
produces components as graphs distinct from the input graph, it will
define subgraphs which are projections of subgraphs of the input graph
onto the component. (If the projection is empty, no subgraph is produced.)
If this flag is set, the component contains only the relevant nodes and
edges.
.TP
.BI \-X " node_name"
Prints only the component containing the node \fInode_name\fP,
if any.
.TP
.BI \-X# " index"
Prints only component number \fIindex\fP, if any, starting at 0.
.TP
.BI \-o " outfile"
If specified, each graph will be written to a different file
with the names derived from \fIoutfile\fP. In particular, 
if both \fB-o\fP and \fB-x\fP flags are used, then each connected
component is written to a different file. If \fIoutfile\fP does
not have a suffix, the first file will have the name \fIoutfile\fP;
then next \fIoutfile_1\fP, then next \fIoutfile_2\fP, and so on.
If \fIoutfile\fP has a suffix, i.e., has the form \fIbase.sfx\fP,
then the files will be named \fIbase.sfx\fP, \fIbase_1.sfx\fP, 
\fIbase_2.sfx\fP, etc.
.LP
By default, each input graph is printed, with each connected
component given as a subgraph whose name is a concatenation of
the name of the input graph, the string "_component_" and the
number of the component.
.SH OPERANDS
The following operand is supported:
.TP 8
.I files
Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot format.
If no
.I files
operand is specified,
the standard input will be used.
.SH RETURN CODES
Unless used to extract a single connected component,
.B ccomps
returns
.B 0
if all the input graphs are connected; and
non-zero if any graph has multiple components, or any error occurred.
If just extracting a single component,
.B ccomps
returns
.B 0
on success and non-zero if an error occurred.
.SH "BUGS"
It is possible, though unlikely, that the names used for connected
components and their subgraphs may conflict with existing subgraph names.
