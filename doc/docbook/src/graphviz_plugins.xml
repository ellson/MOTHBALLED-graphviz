<title>Introduction</title>
<para>
Graphviz plugins are a means of extending the capabilities of the
graphviz tools:
<command>dot</command>,
<command>neato</command>,
<command>fdp</command>,
<command>twopi</command>, and
<command>circo</command>,
</para>
<para>
The initial motivation for the development of plugins was to support
alternative renders based on
<ulink url="http://cairo.freedesktop.org/Home">
<command>cairo</command>
</ulink>,
while keeping
the stable renderer based on
<ulink url="http://www.boutell.com/gd">
<command>gd</command>
</ulink>
available.
The <command>gd</command> renderer does not support anti-aliased lines
(first image).
Simply by installing the graphviz-cairo package the -Tpng renderer is
substituted with one based on cairo (second image).
</para>
<para>
Use of the newly installed plugin requires no change in the user's command.
These images were generated before and after installing 
<command>graphviz-cairo</command>with the command:
<programlisting>
echo "digraph G {hello->world}" | dot -Tpng > hello.png
</programlisting>
</para>

  </imageobject>
</inlinemediaobject>
</para>
<para>
A second motivation was to support GUI interfaces to graphs, but
without bloating the basic version of
<command>dot</command> with dependencies on
<command>gtk</command> or <command>xlib</command>.
The command:
<programlisting>
echo "digraph G {hello->world}" | dot -Txlib
</programlisting>
demand loads the xlib renderer from the graphviz-cairo plugins
and produces a zoomable display of the graph in a window:

<title>Structure and terminology</title>
<para>
A <emphasis>plugin-package</emphasis>,
such as <command>graphviz-cairo-2.6-1.i386.rpm</command>, provides one or more
<emphasis>plugin-libraries</emphasis>.
</para>
<para>
A <emphasis>plugin-library</emphasis> provides plugins that implement various
<emphasis>plugin-apis</emphasis>.
The <emphasis>plugin-library</emphasis> is the unit that is dynamically loaded.
</para>
<para>
There are currently five <emphasis>plugin-apis</emphasis>:
layout, textlayout, usershape, render, device.
</para>
<para>
A <emphasis>plugin-library</emphasis> provides
<emphasis>plugin-types</emphasis>
which implement <emphasis>plugin-api</emphasis>.
e.g. png ps pdf <emphasis>plugin-types</emphasis> implementing the renderer api.
</para>
<para>
Each <emphasis>plugin-type</emphasis> implementation provides a
<emphasis>quality</emphasis> indicator to control
the default selection when there are multiple implementations
of the same plugin-type.
The builtin implementations (if any) have a <emphasis>quality</emphasis>
of 0.
A positive <emphasis>quality</emphasis>
will choose the plugin in preference to the builtin.
A negative <emphasis>quality</emphasis>
will leave the builtin as the default.
</para>
<para>
The plugins are self-describing.
At installation time, <command>dot -c</command> is run to generate
<filename>/usr/lib/graphviz/config</filename> which describes the capabilities
of the available plugin-libraries so that they don't have
to be loaded at startup and can be loaded later on demand.
</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="s1-package">
<title>The graphviz-cairo package.</title>
<para>
The graphviz-cairo package provides multiple plugin-libraries,
all with some dependence on libcairo.so.
In general, a plugin-package can be used to localize all
knowledge and dependencies on some facility like cairo or
gtk or quartz.
The graphviz-cairo package alongside the graphviz base package
is illustrated diagrammatically here:

<para>
	Once graphviz-cairo is installed, and <command>dot -c</command> has
been run as part of the installation process,
the file: <filename>/usr/lib/graphviz/config</filename> contains:

<title>Running dot with plugins</title>
<para>
Dot attempts to be transparent to the user about its use of plugins.
By default it will always chose the highest quality plugin of the matching plugin-type.
Sometimes it is necessary to override the default.
This can be done by explicitly specifying the package to
take the plugin from. e.g. <command>dot -Tpng</command>
takes the highest quality
plugin currently available.
<command>dot -Tpng:cg</command>
takes the png renderer from the codegens.
</para>
<para>
If the package is unrecognized, the dot will return the set of available packages:
</para>
<programlisting>
$ dot -Tpng: hello.dot
Renderer type: "png:" not recognized. Use one of: png:cairo png:cg
</programlisting>
<para>
Also, <command>dot -v</command> will identify all
available plugins for all the apis.

<sect1 id="s1-installing">
<title>Installing plugins</title>
<para>
In order for dot to know what plugin capabilities are available
there is a file called <filename>/usr/lib/graphviz/config</filename> that is created
by running
<command>dot -c</command>
at install time.
<command>dot -c</command>
globs the library directory for all
filenames that look
like they might be plugins, then it goes through and actually
loads each of them in turn, positively verifying that they are
version compatible and loadable, and it then extracts from each
library the set of apis and types that it supports.
It saves this information in <filename>/usr/lib/graphviz/config</filename>.
When dot is run normally by a user, the single <filename>/usr/lib/graphviz/config</filename> file is
loaded but the plugins themselves are not loaded unless a plugin
is demanded from that library.
</para>
<para>
<command>dot -c</command> must be run, with enough privileges to write
<filename>/usr/lib/graphviz/config</filename>, whenever the set of plugins is changed.
For rpm systems
<command>dot -c</command>
is run automatically in %post and %postun
scripts in the rpm specfile.
If building from sources and installing directly,
<command>dot -c</command> is run
by the <command>make install</command> target.
If you are cross-compiling and cross-installing then probably the
best thing to do is to not use demand loaded plugins at all.
There is a <command>dot_static</command>
binary generated which as a basic set of
plugins already builtin.
</para>

<sect1 id="s1-developing">
<title>Developing new plugins</title>
<para>
One of the key goals of the plugin architecture was to allow others
to develop new plugins or plugin-libraries.   In this section I 
describe the structure of the key parts of the graphvz-cairo package
with a view to reusing or hacking them into a new package.
</para>
<sect2>
<title>A plugin-package</title>
<para>
The following files in the source tree for the graphviz-cairo package
can probably be used without change:
<programlisting>
        graphviz-cairo/
        autogen.sh
        cpl1.0.txt
        ltmain.sh.patch
        mkinstalldirs
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
The following files should be changed to suit:
<programlisting>
        graphviz-cairo/
        AUTHORS
        ChangeLog
        NEWS README
        configure.ac
        Makefile.am
        graphviz-cairo.spec.in 
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
Also in graphviz-cairo are a number of GUI related files
specific to graphviz-cairo.
These can be probably not useful for any other plugin based on this code:
</para>
<programlisting>
    graphviz-cairo/
        dot.dot
        dot.png
        dot.xml
        dotedit-splash.dot
        dotedit.desktop.in
        dotedit.indotedit.in
        po/
</programlisting>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>A plugin library</title>
<para>
Each library in the plugin package has its own subdirectory under plugins:
</para>
<programlisting>
    graphviz-cairo/
        plugin/
            Makefile.am
            cairo/
                Makefile.am
                gvplugin_cairo.c
            gtk/
                Makefile.am
                gvplugin_gtk.c
            xlib/
                Makefile.am
                gvplugin_xlib.c
</programlisting>
<para>
graphviz-cairo/plugins/Makefile.am builds all the libraries as SUBDIRS.
</para>
<para>
In each library subdir Makefile.am and a gvplugin_xxx.c.
The gvplugin_cairo.c file is quite short.
It defines the primary entry symbol to the library
which is a structure defining the <emphasis>name</emphasis>
of the library and the address of the table of APIs that it supports.
</para>
<para>
The name: <emphasis>cairo</emphasis>,
the symbol: <emphasis>gvplugin_cairo_LTX_library</emphasis>,
and the filename of the library:
<emphasis>libgvplugin_cairo.so.2.0.0</emphasis>
must be kept aligned for the plugin mechanism to work.
</para>
<programlisting>
#include "gvplugin.h"

extern gvplugin_installed_t gvrender_cairogen_types;
extern gvplugin_installed_t gvtextlayout_cairogen_types;

static gvplugin_api_t apis[] = {
    {API_render, &amp;gvrender_cairogen_types},
    {API_textlayout, &amp;gvtextlayout_cairogen_types},
    {(api_t)0, NULL},
};

gvplugin_library_t gvplugin_cairo_LTX_library = { "cairo", apis };
</programlisting>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Plugin APIs</title>
<para>
The APIs are defined for the plugins by header files:
</para>
<programlisting>
    /usr/include/graphviz/gvplugin_device.h
    /usr/include/graphviz/gvplugin_layout.h
    /usr/include/graphviz/gvplugin_render.h
    /usr/include/graphviz/gvplugin_textlayout.h
    /usr/include/graphviz/gvplugin_usershape.h
</programlisting>
<para>
Also, the set of APIS is defined in graphviz2/lib/gvc/gvplugin.h in:
    #define APIS ELEM(render) ELEM(layout) ELEM(textlayout) ELEM(device) ELEM(usershape)
</para>
<para>
In the core of graphviz, each API is wrapped by a set of functions
that hide the details of the plugin mechanisms from the caller.
</para>
<programlisting>
    graphviz2/lib/gvc/gvdevice.c
    graphviz2/lib/gvc/gvlayout.c
    graphviz2/lib/gvc/gvrender.c
    graphviz2/lib/gvc/gvtextlayout.c
    graphviz2/lib/gvc/gvusershape.c
</programlisting>
<para>
So, to add a new API, minimally what is required
is a new header file, extend the #define APIS,
and a new file of wrapper functions.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title >Plugin types for an API</title>
<para>
The cairo library in particular is developing a number of new backends.
At some point someone will want to use one or more of these new backends.
