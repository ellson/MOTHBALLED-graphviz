/* Hashing a string into an unsigned integer.
** The basic method is to continuingly accumulate bytes and multiply
** with some given prime. The length n of the string is added last.
** The recurrent equation is like this:
**	h[k] = (h[k-1] + bytes)*prime	for 0 <= k < n
**	h[n] = (h[n-1] + n)*prime
** The prime is chosen to have a good distribution of 1-bits so that
** the multiplication will distribute the bits in the accumulator well.
** The below code accumulates 2 bytes at a time for speed.
