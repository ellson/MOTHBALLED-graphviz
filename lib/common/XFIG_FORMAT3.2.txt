The new components in protocol 3.2 are the paper size, magnification,
single/multiple page indicator and transparent color for GIF export in the
header.

The other modification between version 3.1 and version 3.2 of the
protocol is the mathematical model used for splines. The new version
uses X-splines which allows the user to mix interpolation and approximation
points in a same curve. More precisely, it means that an X-spline curve
is neither an interpolated spline nor an approximated one, it is BOTH
(the behaviour of each point is controlled by one single parameter
called "shape factor"). For additional information about X-splines, see:

  "X-Splines: A Spline Model Designed for the End User"
  by C. Blanc and C. Schlick, Proceedings of SIGGRAPH'95

Caveat: Because spline models of previous versions (quadratic B-splines
and Bezier with hidden points) are no longer supported, curves that are
present in version 3.1 and older files are automatically converted to
X-splines. This translation is only an approximation process. It means
that the converted curves are not exactly the same as the original ones.
Though the translation usually provides almost identical curves, some
hand-fitting may be needed in some pathological cases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description of the Fig Format Follows
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) The very first line is a comment line containing the name and version:
	#FIG 3.2

    The character # at the first column of a line indicates that the line
    is a comment line which will be ignored.

(2) The first non-comment line consists of the following:

	string	orientation		("Landscape" or "Portrait")
	string	justification		("Center" or "Flush Left")
	string	units			("Metric" or "Inches")
	string	papersize		("Letter", "Legal", "Ledger", "Tabloid",
					 "A", "B", "C", "D", "E",
					 "A4",   "A3", "A2", "A1", "A0" and "B5")
	float	magnification		(export and print magnification, %)
	string	multiple-page		("Single" or "Multiple" pages)
	int	transparent color	(color number for transparent color for GIF
					 export. -2=None, -1=background, 0-31 for
					 standard colors or 32- for user colors)
	int	resolution coord_system	(Fig units/inch and coordinate system:
					   1: origin at lower left corner (NOT USED)
					   2: upper left)

    Fig_resolution is the resolution of the figure in the file.
    Xfig will always write the file with a resolution of 1200ppi so it
    will scale the figure upon reading it in if its resolution is different
    from 1200ppi.  Pixels are assumed to be square.

    Xfig will read the orientation string and change the canvas to match
    either the Landscape or Portrait mode of the figure file.

    The units specification is self-explanatory.

    The coordinate_system variable is ignored - the origin is ALWAYS the
    upper-left corner.

    ** Coordinates are given in "fig_resolution" units.
    ** Line thicknesses are given in 80-ths of an inch ("display units").
    ** dash-lengths/dot-gaps are given in 80-ths of an inch.


(3) The rest of the file contains various objects.  An object can be one
    of six classes (or types).

	0)	Color pseudo-object.
	1)	Arc.
	2)	Ellipse which is a generalization of circle.
	3)	Polyline which includes polygon and box.
	4)	Spline which includes 
		closed/open approximated/interpolated/x-spline spline.
	5)	Text.
	6)	Compound object which is composed of one or more objects.

    In the following elaboration on object formats, every value of fig
    output are separated by blank characters or new line ('\n').  The
    value of the unused parameters will be -1.

    Some fields are described as "enumeration type" or "bit vector"; the
    values which these fields can take are defined in the header file object.h.
    The pen_style field is unused.
    These values may be defined in some future version of Fig.

    The two color fields (pen and fill; pen only, for texts) are
    defined as follows:

	    -1 = Default
	     0 = Black
	     1 = Blue
	     2 = Green
	     3 = Cyan
	     4 = Red
	     5 = Magenta
	     6 = Yellow
	     7 = White
	  8-11 = four shades of blue (dark to lighter)
	 12-14 = three shades of green (dark to lighter)
	 15-17 = three shades of cyan (dark to lighter)
	 18-20 = three shades of red (dark to lighter)
	 21-23 = three shades of magenta (dark to lighter)
	 24-26 = three shades of brown (dark to lighter)
	 27-30 = four shades of pink (dark to lighter)
	    31 = Gold

	 values from 32 to 543 (512 total) are user colors and
	 are defined in color pseudo-objects (type 0)

    For WHITE color, the area fill field is defined as follows:
	
	-1 = not filled
	 0 = black
	...  values from 1 to 19 are shades of grey, from darker to lighter
	20 = white
	21-40 not used
	41-56 see patterns for colors, below

    For BLACK or DEFAULT color, the area fill field is defined as follows:
	
	-1 = not filled
	 0 = white
	...  values from 1 to 19 are shades of grey, from lighter to darker
	20 = black
	21-40 not used
	41-56 see patterns for colors, below

    For all other colors, the area fill field is defined as follows:

	-1 = not filled
	 0 = black
	...  values from 1 to 19 are "shades" of the color, from darker to lighter.
		A shade is defined as the color mixed with black
	20 = full saturation of the color
	...  values from 21 to 39 are "tints" of the color from the color to white.
		A tint is defined as the color mixed with white
	40 = white
	41 = 30 degree left diagonal pattern
	42 = 30 degree right diagonal pattern
	43 = 30 degree crosshatch
	44 = 45 degree left diagonal pattern
	45 = 45 degree right diagonal pattern
	46 = 45 degree crosshatch
	47 = bricks
	48 = circles
	49 = horizontal lines
	50 = vertical lines
	51 = crosshatch
	52 = fish scales
	53 = small fish scales
	54 = octagons
	55 = horizontal "tire treads"
	56 = vertical "tire treads"

    The depth field is defined as follows:

	 0 ... 999 where larger value means object is deeper than (under)
		   objects with smaller depth

    The line_style field is defined as follows:

	-1 = Default
	 0 = Solid
	 1 = Dashed
	 2 = Dotted
	 3 = Dash-dotted
	 4 = Dash-double-dotted
	 5 = Dash-triple-dotted

    The style_val field is defined as the length, in 1/80 inches, of the on/off
    dashes for dashed lines, and the distance between the dots, in 1/80 inches,
    for dotted lines.

    The join_style field is defined FOR LINES only as follows:

	 0 = Miter (the default in xfig 2.1 and earlier)
	 1 = Bevel
	 2 = Round

    The cap_style field is defined FOR LINES, OPEN SPLINES and ARCS only as follows:

	 0 = Butt (the default in xfig 2.1 and earlier)
	 1 = Round
	 2 = Projecting

    The arrow_type field is defined for LINES, ARCS and OPEN SPLINES
    only as follows:

	 0 = Stick-type (the default in xfig 2.1 and earlier)
	 1 = Closed triangle:
		|\
		|   \
		|      \
		|      /
		|   /
		|/
	 2 = Closed with "indented" butt:
		|\
		\   \
		 \     \
		  \       \
		  /       /
		 /     /
		/   /
		|/
	 3 = Closed with "pointed" butt:
		   |\
		  /    \
		 /        \
		/            \
		\            /
		 \        /
		  \    /
		   |/

    The arrow_style field is defined for LINES, ARCS and OPEN SPLINES
    only as follows:

	 0 = Hollow (actually filled with white)
	 1 = Filled with pen_color

					 center.  Otherwise it is the lower
					 right corner of the string.)
	char	string[]		(ASCII characters; starts after a blank
					 character following the last number and
					 ends before the sequence '\001'.  This
					 sequence is not part of the string.
					 Characters above octal 177 are
					 represented by \xxx where xxx is the
					 octal value.  This permits fig files to
					 be edited with 7-bit editors and sent
					 by e-mail without data loss.
